In a world where legends roam,
Four misfits call the shadows home,
Yes im real leads with no powers to claim,
But as a strategist, he stakes his name.

Through the valleys, through the night,
Guided by a flickering light,
Facing fears they can’t dismiss,
Hearing whispers of the abyss.

Echoes calling, through the mist,
Destiny’s a tangled twist,
Falling, rising, in the fray,
Will they find their way?

Zurii’s wind magic, grand and strong,
But in one spell, her points all gone,
Adam, the god with water's flow,
Reincarnated Yesimreal, he must go.

(Pre-Chorus)
Lost in myths of old untold,
Searching for the strength they hold,
Every step, a chance they miss,
Hearing whispers of the abyss.

Echoes calling, through the mist,
Destiny’s a tangled twist,
Falling, rising, in the fray,
Will they find their way?

Kaz the knight, bears all the pain,
Swings his sword, but all in vain,
Together, they stand as one,
Until the journey's done.

Echoes calling, through the mist,
Destiny’s a tangled twist,
Falling, rising, in the fray,
Will they find their way?

In echoes of the night,
Four souls lost find the light,
In whispers of the abyss,
They'll find what they miss.
